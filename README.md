# SRVFA_AccuracyAndPrecision_Paper
Code for the simulation research on the single reference variable flip angle T1 mapping method

This work also includes data about the proposed T2* correction to the SR-VFA method to bring it into theoretical alignment with the standard variable flip angle (VFA) method
